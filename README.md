# Portfolio
Projects, Skill Showcases, and more!

Check out the project folders above which include a small sampling of some of the Machine Learning focused projects I've done!

Check out https://stockmatch.nn.r.appspot.com/ for a glance at a project I've completed at work! It uses a combination of traditional finance optimization algorithms and a cuistom built timeseries forecasting model to determine potentially profitable portfolios, while taking user risk/preference into account!

Thanks for checking out my portfolio,
Chris

# FourthBrain Independent Project - Histopathological Cancer Detection

This project is dedicated to creating/finetuning/tinkering with a classification algorithm designed to classify [Histopathological Cancer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection/overview) samples. 

This project includes two main Notebooks:

+    [Independent Project - Classic Algorithms](https://github.com/c-s-ale/Portfolio/blob/main/Fourth%20Brain%20Independent%20Project%20-%20Histopathologic%20Cancer%20Detection/Chris%20Alexiuk%20-%20%20Independent%20Kaggle%20Project.ipynb) - Outlines preliminary EDA, basic image processing, and a suite of classic ML algorithms including (SVM, RandomForest, Regression). In addition, it contains comments explaining my thought process as well as reasoning for certain decisions. It also includes some PCA, used to reduce the number of features to permit more effecient training.

+    [Independent Project - Deep Learning](https://github.com/c-s-ale/Portfolio/blob/main/Fourth%20Brain%20Independent%20Project%20-%20Histopathologic%20Cancer%20Detection/Chris%20Alexiuk%20-%20%20Independent%20Kaggle%20Project%20-%20Deep%20Learning.ipynb) - Outlines some more advanced algorithms (basic CNN, AlexNet, transfer learning) as well as contains more robust image augmentation and other more advanced principles. This Notebook is a work-in-progress but has already achieved results of greater than 93% AUC on the private leadboard on Kaggle.com.
